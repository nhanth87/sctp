= Association

Association is a protocol relationship between endpoints.
Its wrapper over actual socket exposing the same API's irrespective if its client side socket initiating connection or server side socket accepting connection.
Also the underlying scoket can be of type TCP or SCTP. 

The Application using {this-platform} {this-application} calls management interface to create new instance of association and keeps reference to this instance for lifetime of association for seding the PayloadData. 

The `Association.java`		API looks like
