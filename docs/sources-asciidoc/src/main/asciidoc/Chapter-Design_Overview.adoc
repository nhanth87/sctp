The prime responsibility of {this-platform} {this-application} is abstract Application from underlying SCTP sockets and expose same API (`Association.java`) irrespective if the underlying SCTP is acting as  server side waiting for client to connect or client side initiating connection.
 

The management (`Management.java`) controls the associations and servers.
The Application can execute commands to create/delete associations/servers.
