		<title>Introduction

		</title>
		<para>
			In computer networking, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
			<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCTP">(SCTP)</ulink>
			is a Transport Layer protocol, serving in a similar role to the
			popular protocols Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User
			Datagram Protocol (UDP). It provides some of the same service features
			of both: it is message-oriented like UDP and ensures reliable,
			in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like TCP.
		</para>
		<para>
			The protocol was defined by the IETF Signaling Transport (SIGTRAN)
			working group in 2000 and is maintained by the IETF Transport Area
			(TSVWG) working group.
			<ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4960">RFC 4960</ulink>
			defines the protocol.
			<ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3286">RFC 3286</ulink>
			provides an introduction.
		</para>

		<para>
			&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;
			is providing the convenient API's over Java SCTP, hence can be used
			only with version JDK 1.7 or above.
		</para>
		<para>
			&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; can also create the TCP sockets exposing same high level API's hence application using &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;
			can work seamless with TCP or SCTP.
		</para>
		<note>
			<para>
				The TCP facility is only for test to support the OS which doesn't have SCTP available out-of-box. For example Windows OS.
			</para>
		</note>
		<para>
			In addition to exposing the SCTP protocol, &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;
			contains number of features which other wise the application depending on
			SCTP will have to take care of. For example &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;
			provides
